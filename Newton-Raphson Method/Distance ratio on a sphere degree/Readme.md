#Finds coordinates of a point on a sphere (in degrees), whose distances from three fixed points are in a given ratio

##Using Newton Raphson Method

Use `main.exe < data.txt`

The first three lines in `data.txt` denote coordinates of points A, B, C, and the fourth line denotes the ratio of the point to be found from A, B, and C, respectively.
